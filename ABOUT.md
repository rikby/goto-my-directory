This is a mature, feature-rich shell script that provides a `goto` command to quickly navigate to directories. Originally designed for the `~/home` directory, it now supports configurable search locations and multiple directories.

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Navigation**: Partial and case-insensitive directory matching
- **Interactive Selection**: Numbered lists for multiple matches, with optional `fzf` integration for enhanced fuzzy searching
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for single or multiple search directories with configurable depth
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture with automatic Python virtual environment activation
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Both simple numbered selection and advanced `fzf` fuzzy finder interfaces

**Development Approach:**
The project uses a structured Change Request (CR) system for feature development, ensuring systematic enhancement and clear documentation of new capabilities. Current development focuses on dynamic search depth control and enhanced user experience features.

**Aliases**: Includes `gt` as a convenient shortcut for `goto`.
